		add attributes tourism
		description "Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture."
		description "	The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards. However, in the wake of some extraordinary archaeological discoveries of a lost civilization, Zug has suddenly also become a popular destination for tourists."

	planet Ingot
		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."

The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."

		description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description "Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
		description "	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal."

It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty."
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description "	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry."
		spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled."
		spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."

Before the Unfettered invaded, the only Wanderer settlements remaining here were the military bases they had set up to defend their frontier. Now, it is home to an ever-growing number of Unfettered settlements, including many civilians who have come here just for the chance to live on a world that is not overcrowded and polluted."
		spaceport "The Unfettered are using the few jump drives they have to ferry more and more of their people into Wanderer space. When each wave of ships arrives here in the spaceport, technicians carefully remove the jump drives from all but a few of them. A few well guarded jump-capable ships then carry those spare jump drives back to Unfettered space, where they are used to bring more ships and people."

The Wanderers did not have time to demolish any of their equipment or to carry it off-world before the planet was lost. As a result, they have given the Unfettered a significant technological advantage here."

		attributes unfettered farming
		description "The Wanderers worked for years to make this desert world bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes."
		description "	Now that the Unfettered have taken over control of the planet, it may be only a matter of time before the deserts dominate it once again."
		spaceport "The spaceport is in a forest village near the planet's north pole. The landing pads are massive stone monoliths laid on the ground in a nearby clearing. But aside from a few large warehouses at ground level, the village itself is entirely made of tree-houses. Although they are very different from Hai architecture, the Unfettered seem to be quite at home living in the tree-houses, and have not built many of their own structures yet."

The Unfettered are clearly doing their best to tend the farms here, but they operate on a permaculture system that relies heavily on maintaining a delicate ecological balance, rather than on machines and pesticides."
		spaceport "A large number of Unfettered settlers have already arrived here and begun setting up a spaceport village, complete with markets, taverns, and military barracks. To the Unfettered, who have lived their whole lives on worlds where the local ecology is in shambles, this planet must seem like a paradise."

Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming."
		spaceport "The raft of algae that supports the spaceport is probably at least a dozen meters thick, but flexible enough that it bends as the ocean swells pass underneath, causing individual buildings to rise up or tilt slightly relative to their neighbors. Now that this world has been captured by the Unfettered, nearly all the buildings are empty; it appears that the Hai are not too fond of the idea of inhabiting a water world, so they are using it mostly as a military base."

		description "Rand is a desert world, too dry for much farming and with gravity low enough to be uncomfortable for most human beings. It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves."
		description "	Due to the results of recent terraforming experiments, Rand has become a moderately more habitable place. Fascination with this change in climate has led to Rand becoming a semi-popular tourist destination of the Dirt Belt."
	planet Tundra
		spaceport "The spaceport village consists of several large domes, which keep out the wind and driving snow; ships enter and exit the largest of the domes through a hatch that closes as soon as they have come through. Before the planet was terraformed, enough snow would pile up on top of one of the domes every decade or so that it became a danger of collapsing under its own weight; the locals would simply move out of that dome and build another one higher up on the snowpack, but the changing climate has reduced the amount of snow enough that the locals may never need to build another dome again."

		description "Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles."

The layout of the streets is completely chaotic, and they have planted rows of trees and bushes everywhere: some inside greenhouses, and some hardier species out in the open air.

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	1 12 3013
		"Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Ship still smells like fish."
	6 1 3014
		"Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore."
	9 3 3015
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	23 4 3015
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	23 4 3015
		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	18 6 3015
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	10 7 3015
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	20 8 3015
		"Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
	26 10 3015
		"Hunting down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack, who have been giving the Free Worlds trouble lately."
	16 1 3016
		"Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant."
	15 8 3016
		"Installed spaceport defense turrets on three frontier worlds. The Free Worlds hopes that this will reduce the piracy in the region."
	2 12 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	19 1 3017
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the Council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	25 1 3017
		"Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic."
	15 2 3017
		"The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner."
	17 2 3017
		"Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one."
	21 2 3017
		"The Free Worlds have retaken the Kornephoros system, with heavy losses on both sides. And unfortunately, there is no sign of Katya; she may have been taken prisoner by the Navy."
	27 2 3017
		"Returned some Navy prisoners of war, after they gave their parole and promised not to take part in any future battles against the Free Worlds."
	12 3 3017
		"Visited the Syndicate and worked out a deal where they promised to stay neutral. They are expecting to profit from selling weapons to both sides in this war. Also discovered that Katya is in the Republic's custody and is accused of terrorist activity."
	2 4 3017
		"Tried to convince Poisonwood, a world adjacent to Free Worlds territory, to switch sides. But, they are fiercely loyal to the Republic because the Navy freed them from being dominated by Alpha warlords decades ago."
	9 4 3017
		"Planted some sensors on the abandoned world of Hope, as an early warning system for Navy raids on Free Worlds space. The Navy appears to be doing something on this world, as well."
	21 4 3017
		"Apparently the paroled Navy prisoners from the battle for Kornephoros plan to keep their promise to not fight against the Free Worlds. They've formed a new Navy regiment guarding the far north of human space."
	8 5 3017
		"Assisted a Kraz Cybernetics engineer known as Barmy Edward with a test of a new and extremely powerful plasma cannon turret."
	31 5 3017
		`Dropped the famous band "There Might Be Riots" off on Wayfarer. They drew quite the crowd, and paid very well.`
	9 8 3017
		"Assisted Barmy Edward with another weapon test: this time, a flamethrower weapon that works by overheating and disabling its target rather than dealing lots of damage to it. It may or may not be useful in actual combat."
	21 8 3017
		"Tomek, from the Free Worlds Council, is trying to decide how to best deal with the threat of the pirates to the south of Free Worlds space."
	16 9 3017
		"The Free Worlds have finally elected a Senate, which will be convening for the first time soon on Bourne."
	29 10 3017
		"Given orders by the Free Worlds Senate to escort a diplomatic mission to the anarchist planet Thule. Tomek is not happy about bargaining with the pirates instead of fighting them."
	5 11 3017
		"The elders on Thule do not want to join the Free Worlds, but they have agreed to crack down on pirate activity in their system and to welcome Free Worlds visitors to their planet."
	11 12 3017
		"Helped to transport some items for building a public university and terraforming research center on Winter. Ijs Springborn will be one of the professors."
	30 12 3017
		"Brought supplies to Smuggler's Den to help upgrade the station into a working deuterium refinery. No further orders from the Free Worlds, so this might be a good time to find ways to earn more money on the side."
	22 1 3018
		"Stopped on Earth with Alondo to talk to Parliament and try to head off another bloody battle. But, they were not willing to negotiate."
	15 2 3018
		"It looks like the Navy has begun using some more powerful beam weapons and torpedoes. Tasked with plundering one of the electron beam weapons so Freya can get a closer look at it."
	4 3 3018
		"Preparing for another major battle with the Navy, this time in the Rastaban system, which just recently expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds but has not been able to do so due to the Navy presence. The Free Worlds will be using a new model of warship, the Dreadnought, in this battle."
	7 3 3018
		"The Navy has been driven out of the Rastaban system. That will allow the people on Harmony, Dancer, New Portland, and New India to join the Free Worlds."
	16 3 3018
		"Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to parole and release them rather than imprisoning them. Hopefully that will earn some goodwill from the Navy in the future."
	19 3 3018
		"Once again there is no immediate work to be done for the Free Worlds. This would be a good time to earn some money for an upgraded ship, if possible."
	30 4 3018
		"Recovered data from a derelict science drone for a team of scientists, who were studying a strange red anomaly in the Terminus system. They suggest that it may be a partially collapsed wormhole."
	12 5 3018
		"Helped the Free Worlds gain access to new ramscoop technology that has been developed in the Deep. This should make it significantly easier to travel long distances through unfriendly systems."
	17 5 3018
		"Three more planets have decided to defect to the Free Worlds: Clark, New Tibet, and New Holland."
	12 6 3018
		"The shipyard on Zug is still trying to ramp up Dreadnought production. So far only a few ships have been built, but Freya will be helping to speed up the process."
	18 6 3018
		"Agreed to become a member of the Free Worlds Council, taking Tomek's spot."
	2 7 3018
		"The Republic world of Poisonwood in the south has apparently been taken over by Alpha warlords. It is such a dire threat that despite the war, the Navy Oathkeepers have agreed to fight alongside the Free Worlds to liberate the planet."
	9 7 3018
		"With the help of the Oathkeepers, liberated Poisonwood from the Alpha invaders."
	24 7 3018
		"The local leaders on the lawless world of Bloodsea have said that they will join the Free Worlds, and stop supporting piracy, in exchange for the equipment to build a more modern spaceport. However, they may just be trying to steal the construction materials; it might be simpler to just attack and conquer them."
	8 8 3018
		"Brought the construction supplies that the people of Bloodsea requested, and they have agreed to join the Free Worlds."
	8 8 3018
		"Freya has announced that Dreadnoughts are now for sale on Zug. Finally the Free Worlds have a warship that can stand up to Navy capital ships."
	22 9 3018
		"The people of Albatross, another anarchist world, have agreed to join the Free Worlds in gratitude for having been liberated from Ryk Bartlett, a warlord who was extorting them for protection money."
	26 9 3018
		"Another two planets, Rand and Oblivion, have expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds. They are rather far from the rest of Free Worlds territory, however, so JJ is worried that it would create an indefensible tactical position."
	1 10 3018
		"The Navy has invaded Rastaban and Delta Sagittarii, effectively slicing through Free Worlds territory and splitting up the Free Worlds fleet."
	7 10 3018
		"As a member of the Council, must make the deciding vote on a difficult decision. A defector from the Syndicate is claiming to have proof that the Syndicate was behind the bombings of Martini and Gemini. If that is true, the Republic may agree to make peace with the Free Worlds. But, refusing to return the defector to the Syndicate would certainly earn their enmity."
	18 10 3018
		"Decided to rescue the Syndicate defector rather than turning him over to the Syndicate. A Questioner who works with Navy Intelligence has confirmed that he is telling the truth, and a ceasefire has been declared. Also, the Navy has agreed to release Katya now that there is evidence proving her innocence."
	15 11 3018
		"Collected atmospheric samples from Mutiny, a planet deep in Syndicate space, and verified that a nuclear test has been performed here using isotopes that match those from the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Also found carefully hidden signs of an underground test site."
	23 11 3018
		"Parliament still refuses to believe that the Syndicate could have been behind the attacks; the Syndicate has far too much power and influence in the government of the Republic. But, the people of the Deep might be more open to the defector's story."
	2 12 3018
		`The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, has proposed a "police action" to arrest one or more of the Syndicate leaders and bring them to justice. It will be a secret joint operation between the Free Worlds, the Deep, and the Oathkeepers.`
	30 12 3018
		"Visited a village on a lawless world in northern Syndicate space, and purchased information on the whereabouts of several of the Syndicate executives who were implicated in the terrorist attacks."
	17 2 3019
		"Dropped off a team of Republic diplomats on Bourne. It seems like for now, the ceasefire is holding, and public opinion is slowly turning to favor the Free Worlds rather than the Syndicate. But the Syndicate leaders must still be brought to justice. The Council will be in touch when they are ready to help launch an attack on the Syndicate."
	16 3 3019
		"The Free Worlds will soon have a new reactor core of their own design available for sale. It probably will not be as advanced as Navy technology, however."
	22 4 3019
		"Preparing to invade Syndicate space with a joint strike force made up of Free Worlds, Deep security, and Oathkeeper ships. The plan is to capture one of the Syndicate executives and bring him to trial."
	13 5 3019
		`Succeeded in capturing a Syndicate executive named Alexander Soylent, but the Syndicate has responded by sending a massive fleet to Sol, supposedly to "protect" Earth but more likely to put pressure on Parliament and the people of Earth to side with the Syndicate.`
	15 6 3019
		"All communications with Rand, which recently joined the Free Worlds but is close to Syndicate territory, have been cut off. It is possible that this is the beginning of a Syndicate invasion."
	19 6 3019
		"No one on Tundra, which is one of Rand's neighbors, has any idea how the hyperspace link was cut off. They wonder if this might have something to do with a star system near Rand that was inaccessible by hyperdrive."
	25 6 3019
		"No one on Arabia knows what has caused hyperspace links in this region of space to suddenly disappear. There are stories of graviton surges and an alien ship, but they may all just be rumors."
	5 7 3019
		"The Syndicate may be cutting off the hyperspace links that join their territory to the rest of human space, in order to escape being punished for their crimes. People are worried that they will try to take over even more territory, including Earth itself."
	13 7 3019
		"Agreed to travel to Syndicate space through the one remaining hyperspace path that is still open, through the uninhabited star systems to the north."
	6 8 3019
		"The Syndicate CEO claims that the disappearing hyperspace links are not their doing, and that in fact they are under attack by aliens. In fact, they say that the Syndicate has had contact with two different alien species in this region - raiders and scavengers known as the Korath coming from the galactic core, and an enigmatic and irrational species named the Pug who occupy the system adjacent to the ones that recently got cut off from human space."
		"By plundering the Korath raiders, the Syndicate has acquired some jump drives, which allow a ship to travel between systems that are not connected by hyperspace links. They are willing to part with one of these jump drives in order to prove the truth of their story to the rest of humanity."
	15 8 3019
		"Located the Pug homeworld, and met with some of them. They say that they have annexed the neighboring systems into the Pug Protectorate in order to stop the human civil war. However, their idea of bringing peace seems to involve conquering human space and replacing the Republic with their own government."
	25 8 3019
		"The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, says that the Pug secretly assisted the people of the Deep to fight against the Alphas centuries ago, during the Alpha Wars. He thinks that the Pug have humanity's best interests at heart, but agrees that they can't be allowed to overthrow the Republic."
	2 9 3019
		"Learned from the Quarg that they have long been aware of the presence of the Pug in the Deneb system. Apparently the Pug are from another galaxy and possess such advanced technology that even the Quarg do not dare to interfere with them."
		"However, the Pug are known to treat warfare like a game, intentionally using weaker technology when fighting less advanced species in order to give them a fair chance at winning the battle. So, fighting them will not be a lost cause, but the Quarg are unwilling to provide any assistance."
	20 9 3019
		"The Free Worlds and Republic Navy are sending a joint fleet into Syndicate space, where they will be fitted with jump drives to make an assault on Pug territory. The Syndicate only has six jump drives available, so this fleet will have to survive without reinforcements until a way is found to reopen the connection to the rest of human space."
	9 11 3019
		"Succeeded in driving the Pug out of the Delta Capricorni system for long enough to land on Maker and explore the technology that the Pug left behind. Freya thinks that she has discovered the device that is used for creating or destroying hyperspace links, but it will take time for her to figure out how to operate it."
	14 11 3019
		"Freya succeeded in reopening the hyperspace link to one of the Syndicate systems. If the same can be done for the link to Sol, the entire Navy will be able to join the battle against the Pug."
	19 11 3019
		"Succeeded in rendezvousing with the Navy in the Sol system and reopening a link to the Pug territory. But now Shiver is under attack by a massive Pug fleet."
	22 11 3019
		"Preparing for the final assault on the Pug homeworld. There seems to be no other option but to force them to surrender, but with the help of the Navy that no longer seems like an impossible task."
	24 11 3019
		`The Pug have fled, apparently traveling through an artificial wormhole back to whatever galaxy they came from. And, it turns out that many of their cities on "Pugglemug" were only for show: buildings with no inhabitants, and with holograms creating the appearance of a heavily populated world. They left no advanced technology behind, and no sign of what their true intentions were, but it turns out that the fake cities here were designed for human habitation. They must have been planning this departure for a very long time.`
		`Now that the Pug are gone, the Navy will be able to use the "graviton reflectors" to repair the broken hyperspace links and to reconnect all of human space.`
	2 12 3019
		"With the Pug defeated, it is finally time to deal with the Syndicate extremists and the Alphas that they allied with. The extremists are armed with nuclear missiles, but the Syndicate CEO has agreed to provide a cloaking device that will make it possible to dodge the missiles."
	9 12 3019
		"Succeeded in drawing the fire of the Syndicate extremists for long enough for a Navy fleet to safely arrive in-system and assist in destroying them. This cloaking device will come in very handy in the future."
	19 12 3019
		"Received an official commendation from Parliament and a promise that the war with the Free Worlds is officially over. Humanity is at peace once more, but new challenges may await in the star systems out beyond human space that are accessible only by jump drive."
	1 8 3020
		`Placed multiple mysterious cubes on planets in the Dirt Belt for the Deep. Deep Security is using these cubes to somehow help in their hunt for a pirate warlord named "Beelzebub."`
	7 9 3020
		"Traveled to a restricted Navy base on Luna. Beelzebub has been causing trouble for both Deep Security and the Navy, so Navy has begun recruiting merchants to help in the search for the warlord."
	21 9 3020
		"Helped to destroy the last of the Navy Cruisers stolen by Beelzebub, but he has escaped. The Navy is still searching, but is no longer asking for help from merchants."
	9 11 3020
		`Helped gather materials for "Project Hawking," an energy and weapons research project being conducted by scientists of the Deep. A pirate Quicksilver attacked the building where the supplies were being placed and crashlanded into the ground, triggering an earthquake.`
	30 11 3020
		"Ran into the scientists who are investigating the anomaly in Terminus. Gave them ten Quantum Keystones from Hai space to examine."
	26 1 3021
		"Scanned Remnant ships beyond the wormhole in Terminus and handed the scan logs over to Ivan and his team."
	22 7 3021
		"The prefects have reached a consensus: now considered a valuable friend of the Remnant, and given permission to purchase their ships and technology."
	17 9 3021
		"Delivered various pieces of Remnant technology to the Deep to be examined. Ivan's project has drawn the attention of the Deep, and the Inhibitor Cannon was taken away by Deep Security before it could be researched."
	14 10 3021
		"Secretly placed sensor cubes near the spaceport of each Remnant planet. Ivan hopes to use the data gathered from these cubes to learn more about Remnant ships."
	1 1 3022
		"Brought Eric and Alaric to Glory, two managers of a mining corporation on Rand hoping to terraform the planet. Terraforming Rand would be immensely expensive, but a girl named Amy has a theory that may make the process cheap."
	8 1 3022
		"Agreed with Amy's idea to steer an asteroid into Rand's polar ice cap in order to change the planet's climate. Hopefully this ends well."
	14 1 3022
		"Amy's theory to terraform Rand seems to have worked. Precipitation around the planet has greatly increased with the introduction of new water into the water cycle."
	27 2 3022
		"Had to travel to Earth to answer for crashing an asteroid into Rand. Luckily, thanks to Alaric and Eric's lawyer, the case was dropped."
	6 3 3022
		"Amy has been noticed by the Deep's Department of Terraforming Research. She will be spending time researching her terraforming theories in the hopes that there are more worlds that can be helped."
	11 4 3022
		"Located the Deep Star Queen that was kidnapped by pirates while en route to Gorvi. Deep Security has finished gathering their rescue fleet and will soon be making the trip to rescue the scientists."
	13 5 3022
		"Escorted the rescued Star Queen back to the Deep. Some of the crew didn't make it. Destroyed the pirate Bactrian that was attempting to prevent the rescue of the Star Queen and was given a city-ship license by Paris."
	10 11 3022
		"Completed a lot of Coalition jobs and received permission to purchase civilian technology and ships."
	26 1 3023
		"Began the process of trying to terraform Tundra with new research from Amy and Nolan. Nolan has suggested that another asteroid be used, but the representative for the Republic overseeing the project is displeased with this approach."
	13 2 3023
		"Fought off a fleet of pirates preventing the terraforming of Tundra, then maneuvered an asteroid into Tundra to trigger the eruption of a supervolcano. Tundra's global temperatures will initially drop, but the increased volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will eventually improve Tundra's climate."
	9 3 3023
		"Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them."
	29 3 3023
		`Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	6 5 3023
		"Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly."
	19 5 3023
		"Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships."
	28 5 3023
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer world against a raid by Unfettered Hai ships."
	31 5 3023
		`Volunteered to help bring a shipment of food to the Unfettered, as "tribute" from the Wanderers, in the hope that it will placate the Unfettered into making peace.`
	16 6 3023
		"Managed to broker a temporary ceasefire between the Unfettered Hai and the Wanderers. Was granted access to purchase the non-military Wanderer ships, as a reward."
	8 9 3023
		"Agreed to try to sell a jump drive to the Unfettered Hai, as a way to get more information from them about who else is providing them with jump drives and enabling their attacks on the Wanderers."
	14 9 3023
		`Learned from the Unfettered Hai that they have been purchasing jump drives from the Alphas (whom they refer to as "unfettered humans").`
	19 11 3023
		`Learned from the Unfettered Hai that they have been purchasing jump drives from the Alphas (whom they refer to as "unfettered humans").`
	6 12 3023
		"Planted some surveillance devices, designed by the Wanderers, in Unfettered Hai space. A month from now, they will be done collecting data on ship movements in the area, and may provide a hint of where the Alphas who are selling jump drives to the Unfettered are coming from."
	29 1 3024
		"Met a human named Elias Hanover who is friends with the Quarg and who has been given permission to use Quarg technology to track the Alpha ship that is selling jump drives to the Unfettered."
	25 2 3024
		"Defeated a Navy Carrier, presumably being operated by the Alphas, that was equipped with Korath fighters and drones. Presumably there is an Alpha base hidden somewhere on the earth-like planet that the Carrier was guarding."
	29 2 3024
		"Admiral Danforth agreed to bring his Cruiser to the planet in Korath space where the Alphas seem to be hiding, with enough troops and equipment to launch an assault on the base."
	13 3 3024
		"The Alphas have fled from the base on Avalon. The Oathkeepers destroyed what is left of the base, which will hopefully set the Alphas back quite a bit."
	29 3 3024
		"Was taken captive, along with Elias Hanover, by some nameless Republic officers who thought Elias was an Alpha. They discovered that he is not one, although he appears to have some of the same genetically engineered advantages that the Alphas have."
	17 4 3024
		"Reported to the Wanderers that the Alphas who had been selling jump drives to the Unfettered have been weakened and driven into hiding. The Wanderers are ramping up production of military ships to try to face the continuing Unfettered onslaught."
	17 7 3024
		"The Unfettered have established a beachhead on one of the Wanderer worlds and are now apparently using what few jump drives they possess to shuttle more and more warships into Wanderer space. War has begun in earnest."
	26 7 3024
		"Helped to evacuate some Wanderers from one of their worlds that is closest to Unfettered space."
	30 7 3024
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer planet from an Unfettered attack. But, the Wanderers now plan to abandon that planet. The Wanderers seem very hesitant to actually stand their ground and fight back."
	10 8 3024
		"Visited the Pug planet adjacent to Wanderer space to see if they are willing to step in and help the Wanderers now that the Unfettered Hai pose such a threat and have captured several Wanderer worlds. But for whatever reason, the Pug insist on the Wanderers fighting for themselves."
	23 8 3024
		"Traveled to the Hai homeworld with Ambassador Sayari to see if she can convince the Hai to take action to restrain the Unfettered from attacking the Wanderers. The most that the Hai were willing to do was to mass a large war fleet near Unfettered space so that the Unfettered have to divert warships there to defend their home worlds."
	27 8 3024
		"The Unfettered are unwilling to agree to even a temporary ceasefire with the Wanderers. They seem to think that they will win this war easily."
	2 9 3024
		`Returned to Wanderer space, and discovered that Iktat Rek has begun the "Molt." He is afraid that because the Eye has not yet opened, the Molt will not be viable and it will end up killing him.`
	5 9 3024
		"Received permission to purchase warships from the Wanderers, including a new one called the Tempest."
	20 9 3024
		"Helped to defend a Wanderer world from yet another Unfettered attack. Meanwhile, the Wanderers are trying to move as many civilians as possible back to their home world, where they will be safe. But, their strategy seems to be based on the hope that sometime soon a wormhole will open and allow the Wanderer people to flee to a new territory and leave their old planets behind for the Unfettered to claim."
	22 9 3024
		"Helped to rescue some Wanderers who were stranded and had to go into hiding in the forest when their planet was taken over by the Unfettered."
	30 9 3024
		"Brought Iktat Rek to a Wanderer hospital facility. His illness, or molt, is progressing, and he has grown much weaker. But his mind is still as sharp as ever, and in fact he has somehow managed to pick up human language just by listening to the words of the translation machine."
	21 10 3024
		"Iktat Rek has been placed in protective quarantine in a germ-free room, where he will receive drugs that will suppress his immune system and allow the genetic change that is taking place in his body to be completed. Even if he survives the process, it may change him beyond recognition."
	26 10 3024
		`The Wanderers have begun producing even larger warships, and have succeeded in driving off yet another Unfettered assault. Afterwards the Pug, whom the Wanderers refer to as the "Keepers," finally sent assistance... in the form of two ships, which they claim are powerful enough to keep the entire Unfettered fleet at bay.`
	7 2 3025
		`The "Eye" wormhole has opened in Wanderer space, but the territory on the other side of the wormhole is Korath space, ravaged by their civil war and still infested with autonomous war machines. Nonetheless, the Wanderers are excited to once again begin their work of healing and repairing damaged worlds.`
	28 4 3025
		`Discovered that the "Kor Mereti" drone ships are controlled by some sort of collective and decentralized artificial intelligence, with no obvious weaknesses.`
	3 5 3025
		`The "Kor Sestor" drones turn out to all be controlled remotely, presumably by either an artificial intelligence or by Korath leaders in hiding on one of their worlds. If the control center could be found, it would be possible to gain control of the entire Kor Sestor fleet.`
	4 5 3025
		`Iktat Rek has survived the Molt, but in a completely new form. Rek is now female, and is only the size of a Wanderer child, and has chosen the name "Ektasi Rek" for herself, meaning something like "communicator" or "bridge-builder."`
	8 5 3025
		"Rek's metamorphosis seems to have given her enhanced ability to understand other languages. She will be staying with the friendly Korath for a while in order to learn how to communicate with them."
	10 5 3025
		"The Quarg (or possibly, a faction within the Quarg, or even just a group of Quarg acting on their own) have agreed to send three of their warships to help defend the Wanderer settlement in Korath space. (Or maybe they are sending the ships because they view the Wanderers as invaders and want to keep an eye on them. It is not easy to determine their true intentions.)"
	13 4 3026
		"Successfully boarded a Ka'het. It appears to be a single, ship-sized organism that can travel in space using a special exoskeleton."
	8 7 3026
		"Discovered an uninhabited, complete Quarg ring in the middle of the Graveyard. It seems weird that they would abandon a ringworld, given how important they are to them."
	27 7 3026
		"Asked the Quarg about the history of the Graveyard. Although not being told the reason for the abandoned ringworld, have learned about the previous inhabitants of the region, the Builders."
	21 8 3026
		"Visited the Pug to see if they are willing to help the Wanderers fight the Korath automata. But the Pug and the Quarg do not get along with each other, and therefore the Pug are not willing to enter Korath space."
	8 9 3026
		"The Wanderers think that it might be possible to infect the Kor Mereti communications network with something akin to a computer virus, to either take control of the drones or disable them entirely."
	16 9 3026
		"Helped to defend one of the friendly Korath worlds from an attack by Kor Mereti drones. There are Korath scientists on that world who have been working for decades to find a way to hack into the Kor Mereti network, but they do not think it is possible."
	26 9 3026
		"Tested a device that the Wanderers thought would be able to force itself into the Kor Mereti network and take control of it. The experiment completely failed, however."
	1 10 3026
		"The Wanderers have a new plan: to try to either subvert or possibly even befriend the Kor Mereti network by connecting it to a powerful Wanderer artificial intelligence."
	14 10 3026
		"The Wanderers want to install one of their artificial Minds on a space station controlled by the Kor Mereti. Their theory is that if the Mind is physically located within a Kor Mereti station, the drones will be much more likely to accept it as part of their own network instead of reacting to it as an outside intruder."
	29 10 3026
		"The Wanderer ploy has succeeded, but with an unexpected result. The Kor Mereti drones have so thoroughly absorbed the Wanderer Mind into their own consciousness that the drones now believe that they themselves are Wanderers."
	1 11 3026
		"The Wanderers have come to believe that prior to the introduction of their Mind, the Kor Mereti network was not actually a self-aware entity, but that it has now become a sentient being in its own right. And, it is apparently a sentient being with a deep interest in gardening."
	15 11 3026
		"Brought a group of Wanderer mentors and teachers to one of the Kor Mereti worlds, where they will seek to build a relationship with the drones and to help them learn to care for living things and to join in the Wanderer work of healing devastated planets."
	5 6 3027
		"Leading some of the friendly Korath on a tour through Wanderer space, to show them how successful the Wanderers have been at repairing and caring for worlds that have been damaged by war."
	31 7 3027
		"Agreed to travel through Kor Sestor space, scanning the planets to try to look for the facility that is remotely controlling the Kor Sestor drones."
	23 8 3027
		"Someone else seems to have located the Kor Sestor command center before the Wanderers did, and has taken control of the Kor Sestor fleet. Most of the Kor Sestor drones flew through the Eye into the old Wanderer territory, where the Wanderers will probably not be prepared to fight them."
	19 9 3027
		"The Kor Sestor fleet has somehow made its way into northern human space, perhaps using a small number of jump drives to ferry ships back and forth the same way that the Unfettered invaders did. Admiral Danforth says that the system where the Korath ships have gathered is home to a secret Alpha base, so he is concerned that the Kor Sestor drones are under Alpha control."
	24 9 3027
		"Recruited some Quarg warships to help defend human space from the Kor Sestor drones, which are now presumably under Alpha control."
	16 3 3028
		"Danforth believes that he has located the Alpha base from which the drones are being controlled; if the base is destroyed the drones ought to become aimless and be easily defeated."
	21 3 3028
		"Dropped some sort of incredibly destructive bomb on the Alpha base on the anarchist world of Zenith. The explosion tore open a hole straight through the planet's crust."
	20 4 3028
		"Succeeded in destroying the last of the Kor Sestor drones that the Alphas brought into human space. Danforth and his Navy base also survived, but he is worried about the political fallout of having to use such a destructive weapon on a populated planet in order to eliminate the Alphas."
	3 8 3028
		"The Kor Sestor drones are still being produced by an automated factory, even though no one is controlling them and they seem to be acting on some sort of mindless autopilot. The Wanderers hope that the Korath exiles will help them to disable the factory."
	15 8 3028
		"Succeeded in communicating with the Korath exiles, by landing on the one habitable planet in their territory. (It seems like the exiles might have a taboo against using weapons on that world.) The exiles agreed to send some ships to help disable the remaining Kor Sestor factory."
	2 9 3028
		"The Korath exiles have kept their bargain with the Wanderers and shut down the final Kor Sestor drone factory, although it may be some time before the last of the existing drones are eliminated."
	18 9 3028
		"Discovered that when the Korath exiles shut down the Kor Sestor factory, they also took enough technology from the factory to be able to begin producing war drones of their own. It is possible that the exiles have just become a whole lot more dangerous than they used to be."
	18 3 3030
		"Agreed to take a piece of wood from a church on Midgard for an archaeologist. Carbon dating suggests that the church was built many centuries before the discovery of the hyperdrive."
	30 3 3030
		"Returned to Midgard with Albert Foster, the archaeologist, to map the area around the church. The instruments discovered what looked like an artificial singularity. Got chased away by Deep ships before being able to look closer."
	9 4 3030
		"Was interrogated by the Deep for helping Albert Foster. The Deep now knows that Albert Foster thinks that there is an artificial singularity on Midgard."
	21 7 3030
		`Brought "There Might Be Riots" to the Hai world of Allhome after escaping a swarm of combat drones that disrupted their performance on Pilot. Ulrich spoke of a cloudy star in the Rim where he heard a voice in his head after parking his ship.`
	13 8 3030
		"Experienced a strange vision while drifting in the Ildaria system that looked like the fall of a civilization of dragon-people. The terrain on the planet of Zug looks strikingly similar to this vision."
	27 8 3030
		"Found the archaeologist Albert Foster and told him about the vision of the dragon-people on Zug. Foster suggested that the vision was the doing of an Archon. He discovered a buried city under the lava flows on Zug; perhaps the vision was a real view of the past."
	4 11 3030
		"With the help of a Quarg ship, fought off a group of antique thieves looking to rob the archaeological site that Albert Foster dug up. Foster will need some time to study what he has found and release the results of his findings."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Arachi
		`The spider-like Arachi were the last of the three Coalition species to discover interstellar travel. Most members of their society owe allegiance to one of the great Arachi "Houses," organizations that are somewhat similar to guilds and that each specialize in one particular form of industry or technology.`
	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
		"Archons are partly biological, partly technological, and partly something that human language has no words for. They are extremely powerful. The Archons are somehow affiliated with the Drak, yet separate from them."
		"For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Pug are hostile toward the Archons, yet also view them as being worthy of pity."
		"When the Korath civil war reached a point where they had nearly driven themselves extinct, the Drak Archons stepped in and offered the surviving Korath an ultimatum: they must either give up their advanced weaponry and live peaceably under the protection of the Quarg, or be banished to some lifeless star systems near the galactic core. Those who chose banishment apparently took with them the secret of how to build jump drives, which has enabled them to raid other species and steal from them."
		"Archons consider it to be their job to enforce peace and to prevent extinction. If they are unable to prevent a species from driving itself extinct, they will still try to preserve some of what that species created as a memorial to them."
		"They are capable of communicating telepathically."
	Factions Builders
		`The Builders inhabited the Graveyard millennia ago, but have since become extinct. They developed some sort of weapon, called the "Ka'het," which stopped obeying their orders and rebelled against them.`
	Factions Coalition
		"The Coalition is an alliance of three different alien species living in peace with each other: the Saryds, the Kimek, and the Arachi. On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Heliarchs
		"The Heliarchs are the rulers of Coalition space: apparently not elected, but instead selected by merit from among the citizens of the Coalition in such a way as to ensure that all three species are equally represented. Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species."
	Factions Ka'het
		"According to the Quarg, the Ka'het were initially a weapon created by the Builders, which then rebelled and led them to extinction. Even in the millennia that passed, they are still being produced in the Graveyard."
	Factions Kimek
		"The Kimek are large insectoid aliens, and are members of the Coalition. They discovered spaceflight after the Saryds, but before the Arachi. They are intensely social creatures, preferring to live together in massive buildings with thousands of inhabitants, and many of their worlds have populations in the tens of billions, far more than any human world."
	Factions Korath
		`The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	Factions "Navy Intelligence"
		"It is unclear why the Navy needs their own intelligence force, since the Republic already has a Department of Intelligence that is incredibly powerful and well-funded. Rumors say that one of the main purposes of Navy Intelligence is to watch for human rights abuses being committed by the Republic itself and for other questionable activities that the Department of Intelligence might turn a blind eye toward or even collude with."
	Factions Oathkeepers
		`The "Oathkeepers" are a regiment of Navy officers who were captured by the Free Worlds and paroled on the condition that they take no further part in fighting against the Free Worlds. They are led by William Danforth, a famous Navy admiral. Their stated mission is to protect the Paradise Worlds from the pirates who live on the anarchist worlds in the far north of human space.`
		"However, the true reason that the powerful Oathkeeper fleet is positioned in the North is not just to keep the pirates at bay, but also to stand as a last defense in case the Hai decide to invade human space. Apparently the Navy has known about the Hai and the wormhole linking their space to human space for some time, but chooses not to make that knowledge public."
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
		"Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living."
	Factions Pug
		"The Pug are aliens with barrel-shaped bodies, spindly legs, and milky blue blood. They claim to have intervened in the human civil war purely for the sake of preventing more bloodshed and helping humans to live together in peace."
		"It is possible that the Pug secretly assisted the humans of the Deep centuries ago by providing them with weapons that helped to turn the tide of the Alpha Wars."
		"The Quarg claim that the Pug are powerful enough that they could defeat the Quarg, or even the Drak, if they chose to. But the Pug treat warfare like a game. When battling another species, the Pug will limit themselves to ships and weapons that are weak enough that the other species has a chance of defeating them."
		"The Pug disappeared from human space, and left behind more questions than answers. It is possible that the true purpose of their attack was to give human beings a common enemy that would force them to band together and forget their internal struggles."
		`The Pug say that their species is split up into separate groups or "teams" that each focus on interacting with a different sentient species. They view those other species as "projects" that they are working on.`
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Saryds
		"Saryds are an alien species who look suspiciously similar to the centaurs found in early human mythology. They prefer to live on worlds with as much green space as possible, and even their major cities are full of parks and gardens. Most Saryds live in small communes with up to a few dozen of them per house."
	Factions Sheragi
		`The Unfettered Hai say that a dragon-like species called the "Sheragi" who are long extinct used to live in human space, back when much of what is now human territory was occupied by the Hai.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	Factions "Unfettered Hai"
		`The "Unfettered" are a faction within the Hai species who are not as peaceful as the rest, and are normally not friendly toward humans. They claim that long ago the Drak altered the Hai to make them docile and peaceful, and that the Unfettered are descendants of those Hai who avoided undergoing that alteration. They are seeking jump drives so that they can escape the "prison" they are now stuck in: a few deteriorating worlds on the far northern edge of Hai space.`
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	Factions Wanderers
		`The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
		`The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
		"It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back."
		"According to the Quarg, the Wanderers are not native to this galaxy, but were brought here from somewhere else (presumably by the Pug)."
	People "Albert Foster"
		"An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector."
	People "Alondo Gruyere"
		`Alondo grew up on Bourne, the relatively prosperous planet on the edge of the Rim that is now the capital of the Free Worlds. He served as a Republic diplomat for years before becoming convinced that Parliament was just using him to "pacify" the less developed worlds in the South with empty promises. He joined the Southern Defense Pact in the early days, before it became the Free Worlds, and is now a member of the Council.`
	People "Edward Tivrusky"
		`Barmy Edward is the Chief Offensive Engineer at Kraz Cybernetics, known for his inventive and sometimes impractical weapon designs. Supposedly, his engineers gave him the "Barmy" sobriquet after an incident where an experimental epoxy cannon he was working on exploded and glued him to the ceiling.`
	People "Ektasi Rek"
		"Ektasi Rek is the first Wanderer in millennia to undergo the Molt, changing into a completely different species with new capabilities. As more Wanderers go through the Molt, the Wanderers as a whole will have to decide which of these mutations represents the best way for their species to survive and flourish in Korath space."
		"Rek's Molt has given her enhanced ability not only to understand alien speech, but to mimic the sound of it as well."
	People "Elias Hanover"
		"Elias has been living with the Quarg in Hai space for a long time, and they trust him enough to give him access to some of their restricted technology."
		"Certain Navy officers believe that Elias may actually be more than five centuries old, and that he may be a genetically modified individual, perhaps specifically designed to have capabilities similar to the Alphas so that he can fight against them."
	People "Freya Winters"
		`Freya is an engineer, specializing in surveillance equipment but with a wide range of talents. She organized the "thousand eyes" program run by the Southern Defense Pact, which was an attempt to reduce the power of the pirate fleets in the region by tracking their fleet movements. Despite her relative lack of interest in politics, she was asked to join the Free Worlds Council because of her expertise in optimizing the distribution and management of resources.`
	People "Ijs Springborn"
		`Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
		"Ijs is now working to found the Conservatory, a publicly funded Free Worlds university that will have a particular focus on terraforming technology. Their goal is to make terraforming methods efficient enough that even Dirt Belt worlds will be able to afford them."
	People "Iktat Rek"
		"Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans."
		`Rek underwent the Molt, a mysterious process in which the body of a Wanderer who is exposed to novel stimuli transforms into a completely new species while still maintaining that individual's memories and personality. The new Rek is a female and goes by the name "Ektasi Rek."`
	People "Jean-Jacques Soleau"
		`Known to most people simply as "JJ," Jean-Jacques grew up in the Dirt Belt and served in the Navy for years before quitting in frustration over the fact that the Navy was no longer defending his home region of space. He now serves on the Free Worlds Council, where he is tasked with coordinating actions between the local militias and shaping them into a single fighting force that can act in concert with each other.`
	People "Katya Reynolds"
		`A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
		"Katya grew up on Hope, a Dirt Belt world that is no longer inhabited because of a supervolcano eruption that triggered a new ice age. Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely."
		"Katya was on Clink when the Navy invaded the Kornephoros system, and was taken captive by them and imprisoned as a war criminal."
	People "Meto Pa'aret"
		`Pa'aret runs a Wanderer artificial intelligence laboratory. He is in charge of the effort to establish a connection between the Wanderers and the Kor Mereti collective by introducing a Wanderer "artificial Mind" into the collective.`
	People Raven
		"Raven, whose full name is unknown, is a Questioner who works for Navy Intelligence. Through some combination of training and natural ability, she is able to reliably detect whether or not someone is telling the truth."
	People Sayari
		"Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well."
	People "Sobari Tele'ek"
		"Tele'ek is a Wanderer military commander. It is not clear what his rank is or whether or not the Wanderer military is even organized enough for individuals to have ranks, but he has been placed in charge of holding back the Hai while the remaining Wanderer worlds near the front are evacuated."
		"Tele'ek became part of the expeditionary force that was formed to explore the territory beyond the Eye once it opened."
	People "Tema'a Iriket"
		"Iriket is a Wanderer specializing in terraforming, who has been selected to survey the worlds beyond the Eye and to make plans for how each one can be made to flourish once more. She is far more interested in the terraforming work than in dealing with the threat of the Korath war machines."
	People "Tom Paris"
		"Paris is a high ranking guard in Deep Security, equivalent to an admiral in the Republic Navy. While most of Deep Security is designed to keep the Deep safe internally and repel any pirates that might try to make their way into the region, Paris is in charge of Deep Security's external affairs, defending the Deep's interests outside its own borders."
	People "Tomek Voigt"
		"Tomek is a young and ambitious militia commander. His brilliant tactical leadership and charismatic personality gained him quite a following in the Dirt Belt region even before the Free Worlds came into existence. He was asked to join the Council in part because of his popularity with the local militias throughout the region."
		"Tomek was removed from the Council and placed under house arrest by the Senate after he disobeyed their orders and tried to launch an attack to capture the Pirate world of Greenrock rather than pursuing the diplomatic solution that the Senate preferred."
	People "William Danforth"
		`Danforth is a famous Navy Admiral who is a folk hero throughout human space due to his fair and honorable behavior and his willingness to use his fleet to assist people in need, even when he has to go against Parliament's orders to do so. He is currently in charge of the Navy regiment who call themselves the "Oathkeepers."`
